// # State Nodes
// |done|done|done|done|tbd|done|tbd
// To define a [→state node](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/statenodes.html), just write its name on a line of its own.
// Names of state nodes may contain any word, non-word or whitespace characters except `|`, `{`, `[`.
// Special syntax like `//` or `->` is also not permitted.
My 1st State (couldn't think of a "better" name) // normal parentheses and quotation marks are allowed, too

// A [→compound state](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/hierarchical.html) is denoted by a pair of braces {}.
// State nodes nested inside the braces are considered child nodes
State 2 {
  State 2a // The first child state will be automatically deemed the "initial" one
  State 2b // This one won't be auto-selected
}

// Using brackets [] instead of curly braces defines a [→"parallel" compound state](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/statenodes.html#state-node-types)
Parallel State [
  I will be selected ...
  I will, too { // any combinations of [] and {} are valid, too
    A // auto-selected as soon as "Parallel State" is entered
    B // unselected by default
    C // unselected by default
  }
]

// # Transitions
// |done|done|done|done|tbd|done|tbd
// Inside a state's braces (or brackets), use the arrow syntax `->` to define a transition to another state.
// Transition targets are looked up within the current compound state's scope first;
// if no matching target is found, the search continues one level higher until a match is found.
//
// Combine `->` with the `on` keyword to define an event transition triggered by `SOME_EVENT`
Some State {
  on SOME_EVENT -> Another State 
}

// You can also define "after transitions" based on a timeout with the `after` keyword.
// Valid units for the time span are ms|milliseconds?|s|sec(ond)?s?|m|min(ute)?s?|h|hours?
// Omitting the unit means milliseconds by default.
// As a convenience, the format m:ss can be used to specify a combination of mins and secs: 3:25 is equivalent to 205s
Some Other State { 
  after 20s -> Another State
  after 3:25 -> Yet another state
}
Another State // This will be selected after 20 seconds
Yet another state // This will be selected after 3 minutes and 25 seconds

// Transitions without `on` or `after` become ["always transitions"](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/transitions.html#eventless-always-transitions):
// As soon as the state is entered, it is "redirected" to @omg
Transitory {
  -> @omg
}

// Nested transition targets can be qualified by separating the scopes with a pipe `|` sign
Unrelated State {
  after 2min -> Parallel State | I will, too | C // this will only transition if someGuard evaluates to true
}
C // If the above transition target had just been specified as `-> C`, this would have been selected instead

// Prepend a state node definition with `@someLabel` to assign `someLabel` to the state node for easier reference in transitions
@short This state has a very long name ...
Good we don't have to type all that again {
  on MY_EVENT -> @short
}

// Labels provide an *absolute* alternative to referencing a state through its (relative) path.
// They have to be unique across a Flow file, and they must not be mixed with path information,
// i.e. a reference like `-> State name | @label` will lead to an error.

// # Conditions and Variables
// |done|done|done|tbd|tbd|tbd|tbd

// Inside Flow scripts, you have access to three kinds of variables:
// 1. [Global variables](#global-variables) like `userName`
// 2. Utility variables in the current [Flow Scope](#flow-scope)
// 3. Shared [Challenge Data]

// All available variables can be used for message interpolation by preceding their name with a `$` sign:
Intro {
    Nick "Hello, $userName"
}
// When used in string interpolation, 

// #### Global Variables
// In every Flow you have access to a fixed set of global variables which are listed below. These variables are managed automatically, e.g. the `userName` will always be set based on the profile of the logged-on user.

// ##### `userName` (string)
// The first name of the current user. E.g. if a user's profile has stored a name of *Alex Baldwin*, `VZ "Hi, $userName!"` will have VZ send out "Hi, Alex!"

// ##### `className` (string)
// TBD

// ##### `classSize` (number)
// The number of students in the class currently signed in.

// #### Flow Scope
// Each Flow may define its "own" variables that are set at one point of execution, and checked in another. These variables belong to the scope of the current Flow, so you cannot access them from other Flows.

// If a state node name begins with an exclamation mark `!`, it will be interpreted as a variable assignment. The assignment is expected to be of the form `varname = expression`, where `varname` and `expression` can be any valid JS variable name and expression, respectively. `varname` will be either defined or re-assigned within the current Flow scope, and can then be used in message interpolation or [conditional transitions](#conditional-transitions).

// Example:
State A {
    ! groupSize = classSize / 5
    ...
    if groupSize < 3 -> State B
}
State B {
    ...
}
// #### Conditional Transitions
// If a transition definition contains an `if` clause, it becomes a [→"guarded" (conditional) transition](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/guards.html).
// The condition can be either the name of a (globally predefined) guard 
// or any JS expression referring to the current Flow variables
after 2min if someCondition -> Target // this will only transition if `someCondition` evaluates to true
on MY_EVENT if a == 3 || userName != 'phil' -> Target // assuming `a` is defined somewhere

// Replacing `if` by `when` + a state node reference will check if that state is (also) selected; only then the transition will happen
after 5min when Parallel State | I will, too | A -> Talkative

// # Shortcut Syntax
// |done|done|tbd|tbd|tbd|tbd|tbd
// To define a sequence of states where two subsequent states are connected by exactly one transition,
// you can use a special shortcut syntax without `->`
State A
after 1s
State B
on PLAY if x < 0.5
State C

// The above is equivalent to the more verbose definition
State A {
  after 1s -> State B
}
State B {
  on PLAY if x < 0.5 -> State C
}
State C

// # Directives
// |wip|tbd|tbd|tbd|tbd|tbd|tbd|
// Next to child state nodes and transitions, you can also define that certain actions should be triggered
// once a state is reached. This can be done through Flow *directives*, which are single-word commands
// (similar to function names in other programming languages) preceded by a leading dot:
beware of the dog! {
  .biteUser
}

// Many times, directives have *arguments* that modify or specify its behavior. Everything following a
// directive's name on the same line (except comments) is considered its argument(s), but the concrete format and meaning
// depends entirely on the directive in question. This is much like the way command-line tools work: Each
// one has its own way of interpreting the command line, and ideally, that way is the most convenient
// one for its specific use-case. Here are some examples:
.showApp Dictionary
.loadChallenge Drone
.have VZ appear in Wire
.have VZ jump

// It is possible to place directives directly after `on` or `after` statements (without the
// `->` transition marker). The event or timeout will trigger the specified action just like
// it would otherwise trigger a transition when used with a target state. Keep in mind that when using `on`
// or `after` in this way, the surrounding state will not be left! Continuing the example from above:
Beware of the dog! {
  .bark
  after 3s .bark louder
  on SELF_DEFENSE .bite burglar
}

// Here is a list of all directives currently supported by the Mastory app.
// Optional arguments are denoted by [brackets]; all other listed arguments are mandatory.
//
// #### `.focusApp`
.focusApp AppName
// - `AppName` – one of the available apps-in-the-app: `home`, `wire`, `messenger`, or `vlog`
//
// Ensures that `AppName` is visible for the user, switching the "currently selected app" to `AppName` if necessary.
//
// #### `.inChallenge`
.inChallenge EventName OptionsObject
// - `EventName` – the name of an event that can be interpreted by the currently loaded challenge state machine.
// - `OptionsObject` – a JavaScript object of the form `{option1: value1, option2: value2, ...}` containing any
//   additional event-related data to be forwarded to the challenge state machine.
//
// This directive can be used to dynamically influence the current challenge from the Flow script.
// Each challenge defines the unique list of events that its [→Challenge State Machine](https://github.com/mastoryberlin/app/tree/master/challenges)
// "understands", many times by transitioning to a different state. To manipulate `SomeChallenge`'s UI or internal
// data in a certain way, check its specs in the `app` project's hierarchy at `challenges/SomeChallenge/README.md`.
//
// Note that `EventName` must *exactly* match the event name defined by the challenge state machine, as no automatic case-translations will be performed.
// Likewise, the `OptionsObject` will be passed to the challenge state machine's `send()` function as-is, so make sure to also
// match the expected data format to reach the intended result.
// 
// #### `.loadChallenge`
.loadChallenge ChallengeName
// - `ChallengeName` – the name or ID of a challenge, i.e. the name of the `app` project's subfolder it is contained in under `challenges`.
//
// Loads the challenge `ChallengeName` in the Wire, including its Vue component, challenge store, and challenge
// state machine. `ChallengeName` will be matched against all available challenge names in a case-insensitive
// manner.
//
// Note that `.loadChallenge` does not automatically focus the Wire app. To do so, you will need to include
// a [`.focusApp`](#focusapp) directive as well.
//
// #### `.unloadChallenge`
.unloadChallenge
//
// Unloads any currently loaded challenge, leaving the Wire app in the state where it reads "No challenge available".

// # Messenger Conversations
// |tbd|done|tbd|tbd|tbd|tbd|tbd
// **IMPORTANT: The following specs are still in development and should not be relied on!**
//
// State names ending with a "quoted" string are interpreted as *messages*:
// When they are entered, the message will be sent either in the chat or by the assistant.
Talkative {
  Alicia "Hi!"  // Specify the name of the sender (NPC) before the message
  after 1s
  "There is a new message available." // A message without a sender is interpreted to be a global message by the assistant.
  after 4sec
  @how Alicia "How are you?"
  ... "I'm not so good today😞" // a shortcut meaning "same sender + default timeout"
  on USER_REACTION
  Alicia "Thank you for listening to me, $userName!" // Within message texts, you can inject the values of contextual variables using $ + varname
                                                 // Besides $userName, you can use $className and $teacherName
  on RESTART -> @how
}

// Interactive conversations ("NLU contexts") can be defined by adding a state node called ? as the initial child of a compound state:
VZ "Hi, did you also get Alicia's messages?" {
  ? // This will wait for user input, process it, and select the best match among the provided intents
  "yes" {
    -> @omg // This is an "always transition": As soon as the state is entered, it is "redirected" to @omg
  }

                                    // The quoted string is just an (optional) description in this case.
                                    // Once the media source is added, the above line of code will be changed into something like:

                                    // (the fact that is it an AUDIO source will then be derived from the URL file extension)

    VZ IMAGE "cloud message" // ... same thing can be done for an image source ...
    after 5s

    VZ VIDEO "Challenge intro 2" = introVideo {
      // with the "= ..." syntax, the media file / URL is linked with an identifier (constant) for reference
      // wherever the assigned identifier appears throughout the flow script, it will be replaced by the actual URL
